The file 'exactSolution.py' reproduces the exact solution derived in Tracy 2006 (https://doi.org/10.1029/2005WR004638), where details can be found in Table 1. Using the nomenclature of Tracy 2006, we use a = 1 m, L = 1.25 m, Ks = 1e-05 m/s, hr = -10 m

The file 'multiMaterial.py' produces a simulation involve the infiltration of water into a body composed of two materials, sand and clay, as illustrated by:

The file '..." produces a simulation with a custom mesh created with gmsh (https://gmsh.info/).
